KEY CONCEPT ( You only pay what you use )

- What Is Cloud Computing ?
	1. The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
	2. It allows rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources, enabling you to scale resources up or down as needed.
	3. Eliminates the need for large upfront investments in hardware and reduces time spent on hardware management.
	4. Provides easy access to servers, storage, databases, and application services over the Internet.
	5. Platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) own and maintain the hardware, while users provision and use resources through a web application.

- Advantages Of Cloud Computing.
	1. Pay only for what you use, eliminating the need for large upfront investments in hardware.
	2. Benefit from cost efficiencies as cloud providers serve many customers, reducing costs compared to managing your own infrastructure.
	3. Easily scale resources up or down based on demand without overcommitting to capacity.
	4. Quickly deploy and manage resources within minutes, enhancing business agility.
	5. Spend less time managing IT infrastructure and focus more on core business activities.
	6. Deploy applications closer to your customers globally, reducing latency and improving performance.

- Cloud Computing Deployment Model
	1. Cloud-Based Deployment ( Public Cloud )
	   
	   The public cloud is a cloud computing model where cloud infrastructure services are provided over the internet to the general public or large industry groups. 
	   
	   1. Anyone can access systems and services, making it open but potentially less secure.
	   2. The cloud infrastructure is owned by the cloud service provider, not the consumer. Applications and their components, like virtual servers and databases, are fully based in the cloud.
	   3. Provides storage, backup, and retrieval services, often offered for free, by subscription, or on a per-user basis.
	   4. Ideal for cloud hosting, where services are provided to multiple customers efficiently.
	   
	   Advantages
	   
	   1. No substantial upfront costs due to the pay-per-use model, making it ideal for businesses needing immediate access to resources.
	   2. Cloud service providers subsidize the entire infrastructure, so no hardware setup is needed.
	   3. Users do not need to manage the infrastructure; the service provider handles it.
	   4. Maintenance is fully managed by the service provider, freeing users from these responsibilities.
	   5. Resources can be scaled up or down on demand to meet business needs.

	   Disadvantages
	   
	   1. Public access to resources makes the public cloud less secure, with no guarantee of high-level security.
	   2. Since it is used by many, the public cloud offers limited customization options to meet individual requirements.
	      
	2. On-Premises Deployment ( Private Cloud )
	   
	   The private cloud is a cloud computing model where resources are deployed on-premises using virtualization and resource management tools. It is also known as the "private cloud" and provides dedicated resources within a secure environment managed by an organizationâ€™s IT department.
	   
	   1. Resources are hosted within the organization's own data center, offering greater control and security but lacking some benefits of cloud computing.
	   2. Unlike the public cloud, the private cloud is a one-on-one environment, where the hardware is not shared with others.
	   3. Provides complete control over service integration, IT operations, and policies, allowing for tailored solutions to specific business needs.
	   
	   Advantages
	   
	   1. Full ownership and control over IT operations, policies, and user behavior.
	   2. Enhanced security and privacy, ideal for sensitive corporate information, with restricted access for authorized personnel only.
	   3. Compatible with legacy systems that may not be suitable for public cloud deployment.
	   4. Offers flexibility to customize solutions according to specific organizational needs.

	   Disadvantages
	   
	   1. Limited scalability compared to public clouds due to fewer clients and resources.
	   2. Higher costs associated with maintaining a personalized and dedicated infrastructure.
